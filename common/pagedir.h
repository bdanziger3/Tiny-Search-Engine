/**************** pagedirTest ****************/
/* checks whether a given path is a writeable directory
 * create file in directory and check success
 * Creates an empty file with name dirName/fileName
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *      dirName is a pathname to a directory which is being tested as the pageDirectory
 *      fileName is the file name under which to save the test file
 *
 *  Returns true if file successfully written â€“ the directory is writeable
 *  Returns false if unsuccessful - the path is not a valid writeable directory or memory allocation error

/**************** pagesaver ****************/
/* Saves a single webpage to a single file named with a page ID
 * Stores the url, the page depth, and the contents of the page to the file
 * 
 * Writes the URL on the first line
 * Writes the depth of the page on the second line
 * Writes the page content beginning on the third line
 *
 * Parameters:
 *	page	must be a non-null pointer to malloc'd memory holding a webpage_t item
 *	dir		must be a valid name of a writeable directory to which the file are saved
 *	id		is an integer id which will be the name of the file where the webpage is saves
 *  
 * It is the caller's responsibility to make sure that:
 *		dir is a valid writable directory.
 * 		the page item has valid depth value and non-null pointers url and html
 *		the ids are unique for each webpage
 * 
 * Assumes that the system on which the program is run accepts double slashes "//" in path names
 * This assumption is satisfied on the cs.dartmouth.edu linux servers
 * Assumes that the page parameter has non-NULL data for URL, HTML, and depth
 * Assumes that dir is a valid writeable directory

/**************** pageLoader ****************/
/* loads webpages from the page directory into webpage_t items given the ID
 *
 * Returns:
 *		a webpage structure containing the data from the webpage file if run correctly
 *		NULL if there is no file with the given document ID or memory allocation error
 *
 * Parameters:
 *      dir		dir must be a valid name of a writeable directory from which the webpages are being loaded
 *		id		is an integer ID, the name of the file being loaded
 *
 *	It is the caller's responsibility to make sure that dir is a valid writable directory
 *  It is the caller's responsibility to make sure that the doc id files are formatted as follows:
 *      URL on the first line
 *      depth on the second line
 *      HTML starting on third line
